# Fizz Buzz TDD

> In this project we implement a class with some methods, but we do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). The idea is to write tests first and then the code. This can be verified in out commits history.
>
> - Write unit tests using Rspec. 
> - Understand an existing codebase in a way that allows for adding tests. 
> - Write Rspec unit tests with mocks. 
> - Understand the TDD concept.
